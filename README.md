# Stats command
Accesses data from the site https://u.gg and gets Talon's winrate, pickrate, and banrate. Region, rank, and role can be customized by simply adding it after the command. 
IE: @Talon Bot stats NA diamond jg -> returns the stats for Jungle Talon in NA Diamond+.
### Command temporarily suspended
Due to the page source of the website no longer having the key data for the webscraping script, the requests library can no longer be used to accomplish its task. The Selenium framework has to be used to execute the Javascript necessary to obtain the data. While this does work on its own, due to the large memory usage and time delays when deployed on the cloud, it is not viable to have this command run on a discord bot. As such, the command will be suspended until further notice.

The code for it is in the talonBotShelved folder. Simply replace the original files with the ones in the folder.
